    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400 g cottage cheese (9% fat)</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 tbsp flour (plus extra for coating)</li>
        <li>3 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>3-4 tbsp sunflower oil for frying</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt</li>
        <li>10 g vanilla sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>STEP-BY-STEP RECIPE:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Transfer the cottage cheese (400 g) into a small glass or plastic bowl. 
            Add a pinch of salt, one egg, 3 tbsp of sugar, and 10 g of vanilla sugar. 
            I don't like my cheesecakes to be very sweet, but you can add a bit more sugar, for example, 4 tbsp. 
            You can use both farmer's market and store-bought cottage cheese for cheesecakes. 
            The main thing is that it's not too sour and not overly moist. 
            If you're using store-bought cottage cheese, choose the one in soft polyethylene bags.
        </li>
        <li>After you place all the ingredients in the bowl, mix them until you achieve a uniform consistency. 
            It's best to use a regular fork, spoon, or a potato masher for this purpose.
        </li>
        <li>Add 3 tablespoons of wheat flour to the resulting cottage cheese mixture. 
            If the cottage cheese turns out to be quite moist, then add one more tablespoon of flour. 
            However, the key is not to overdo it, so that the cheesecakes turn out tender.
        </li>
        <li>Moisten your hands with a small amount of sunflower oil and roll small balls, about 3-4 cm in diameter, from the cottage cheese mixture. 
            Flatten the balls with your hands to create beautiful small cheesecakes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now, coat the cheesecakes in flour to help them retain their shape and fry them until they have a delicious crispy crust.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a non-stick skillet with 3-4 tablespoons of sunflower oil over medium heat. 
            The skillet for the cheesecakes should be well heated. 
            Do not reduce the heat while frying; this way, you'll achieve the perfect browning. 
            Keep an eye on them to ensure the cheesecakes do not burn. 
            To achieve a beautiful golden crust, I fried the cheesecakes for 2-3 minutes on each side. 
            However, it may take slightly more or less time for you.
        </li>
        <li>
            To remove excess oil from the finished cheesecakes, first transfer them onto a paper towel. 
            Then, place the cheesecakes on serving plates, sprinkle with a little powdered sugar, and add jam or sour cream to taste.
        </li>
    </ol>
